                    <p>When I'm not working or studying, you might find me playing guitar, listening to  music, or outside catching some sunshine. I am an avid collector of vinyl records, my favorite lately being <em>Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon</em> by James Taylor. I love to be outside as much as possible, whether I am hiking, biking, snowboarding, or reading a book in my hammock!</p>
