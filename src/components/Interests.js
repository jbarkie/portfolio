                    <p>When I'm not working or studying, I have several hobbies that keep me very busy. 
                        I play guitar, bass, drums, and piano, and enjoy listening to all kinds of music. I  enjoy collecting vinyl records, and currently, my favorite record to spin is <em>Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon</em> by James Taylor. I love to be outside as much as possible, whether I am hiking, biking, playing basketball, or just catching some sunshine! </p>
